# Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Apply the Random Forests algorithm but this time only by upscaling the data.
- Discuss the output and its impact in the bussiness scenario. Is the cost of a false positive equals to the cost of the false negative? How would you change your algorithm or data in order to maximize the return of the bussiness?
